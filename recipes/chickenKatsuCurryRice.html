        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chicken Katsu Curry is a comforting Japanese dish that combines crispy, golden-fried chicken cutlets with a rich, savory curry sauce served over fluffy steamed rice. The contrast of crunchy panko-coated chicken and velvety curry creates a deeply satisfying meal that’s both hearty and full of flavor. It’s a crowd-pleasing favorite that’s surprisingly simple to make at home.</p>

        <p>The curry sauce is mild, slightly sweet, and aromatic, simmered with onions, carrots, and potatoes until tender. Paired with freshly fried katsu and warm rice, it’s a complete meal perfect for weeknights or a cozy weekend dinner.</p>

            <li>2 carrots, sliced</li>
            <li>2 medium potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
            <li>3 cups water or chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 block Japanese curry roux (such as Golden Curry or Vermont Curry)</li>
            <li>Steamed white rice, for serving</li>

        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Pound the chicken breasts to an even ½-inch thickness, then season both sides with salt and pepper.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Dredge each chicken breast in flour, dip into the beaten eggs, and coat thoroughly with panko breadcrumbs; set aside.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Heat oil in a deep skillet or pot to 350°F (175°C) and fry the breaded chicken until golden brown and fully cooked, about 5–6 minutes per side. Transfer to a wire rack and let rest.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In a separate pot, sauté the sliced onion until softened.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Add the carrots and potatoes, stirring for 2–3 minutes before pouring in the water or chicken broth.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Add the curry roux blocks, stirring until dissolved and the sauce thickens. Simmer for an additional 5 minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Slice the cooked chicken katsu into strips.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Serve a mound of steamed rice on a plate or bowl, ladle the curry sauce over the rice, and place the sliced katsu on top.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Garnish if desired and enjoy!</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
